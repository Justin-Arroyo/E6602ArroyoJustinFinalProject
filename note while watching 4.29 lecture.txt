I am slightly confused about H2 and Hinf
You can calculate for a basic system A B C and D but I think what really matters is designing a controller and an observer and finding Acl Bcl Ccl and Dcl, then computing H2 or Hinf of that.
But maybe actually H2 controller design creates those Acl Bcl Ccl and Dcl that do minimize H2? 
And Hinf. 
Okay....
